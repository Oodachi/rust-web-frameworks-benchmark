# Benchmarking Rust Web Frameworks: hyper vs gotham vs actix-web vs warp vs rocket

I was building a very performance sensitive API service using Rust and I was trying to find out which http framework I should use
as there a lot of frameworks out there for Rust. So, I just shortlisted some of them and I ran a `hello world route` for every frameworks
and its result is very interesting.

## Benchmarking Tool

I used `wrk` to test those http servers:

```sh
$ wrk --latency -t4 -c200 -d8s http://127.0.0.1:8081
```

## Results

I ran all those tests on:

`MacBook Pro, 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 processor with 4 cores, 16GB of RAM`

Before run, I created a release build:

```sh
$ cargo build --release
```

## Conclusion

`hyper`     -> Perfect for an app which requires more controls on http and performance. It provides `async` with `tokio.rs`.

`gotham`    -> A high-level version of `hyper`.

`actix-web` -> Provides a very high-level API and injects some boilerplate code as well as runtime. It provides `async` with `tokio.rs`.

`warp`      -> A very high level version of `hyper` and easy to use and it requires a few lines of codes to start a server. It provides `async` with `tokio.rs`.

`rocket`    -> The performance it gave was not expected at all. No async.s
